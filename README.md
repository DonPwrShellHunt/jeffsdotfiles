# Don's dotfiles

My configuration. Minimalist, but helps save a few thousand keystrokes a day. I use Mac OS X, so I can only guarantee they'll work with OS X, but I use some of these dotfiles on various linux servers, and they seem to be pretty flexible.

I noticed Jeff has migrated from bash to zsh in the upstream repository. Perhaps this is a good indication I should do the same. If I start with a bare minimum version of the zsh dotfiles, just those pieces I fully understand, that would be a reasonable start.

## links in ~/ point to corresponding files in Code/dotfiles repo

```bash
lrwxr-xr-x   .bash_profile -> /Users/donhunt/Code/dotfiles/.bash_profile
lrwxr-xr-x   .gitconfig -> /Users/donhunt/Code/dotfiles/.gitconfig
lrwxr-xr-x   .gitignore -> /Users/donhunt/Code/dotfiles/.gitignore
lrwxr-xr-x   .inputrc -> /Users/donhunt/Code/dotfiles/.inputrc
lrwxr-xr-x   .vimrc -> /Users/donhunt/Code/dotfiles/.vimrc
```
